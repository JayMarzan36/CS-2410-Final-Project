CS-2410 Final project

The class is a intro to gui and event driven programming. And for the final project I had recreated IMDB using https://www.themoviedb.org api for getting all the data.

I worked on this on and off for a week and then spent 2 days on the last little bit.

If you want to run this you will need to get an api key from https://www.themoviedb.org, and put it in api.js, and the "main" page is "index.html".
